MATLAB/C Implementation of Part-Structured Models

This package contains m-files for implementing part-structured inkball
models, as described in the paper listed below. This code serves as
the reference implementation for that paper. If you find the software
useful, and your use of the material leads to a publication, please
cite the paper below. I also appreciate notes of acknowledgement if
you feel so inclined. Thanks!
